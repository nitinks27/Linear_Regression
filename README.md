# Linear_Regression
Here I've solved a Kaggle dataset using Linear Regression technique.

# About the Data
I've gathered the dataset of Fuel Consumption, which have specific columns as explained below:

MODELYEAR e.g. 2014

MAKE e.g. Acura

MODEL e.g. ILX

VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV

ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7

CYLINDERS e.g 6

TRANSMISSION e.g. A6

FUELTYPE e.g. z

FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9 -> FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY

FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9 -> FUEL CONSUMPTION on HIGHWAY

FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2 -> FUEL CONSUMPTION COMBINED (CITY + HIGHWAY)

CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0
